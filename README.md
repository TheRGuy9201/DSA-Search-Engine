## 📋 Features

- **Search Engine**: Find algorithms and data structures by name, category, or complexity
- **Detailed Information**: Access comprehensive details on time/space complexity, implementation, and use cases
- **Examples**: View practical examples of algorithm implementation and usage
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across desktop and mobile devices

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- **React 19**: The latest version of React with improved performance
- **TypeScript**: For static type checking
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling
- **Vite**: For incredibly fast development and build
- **React Router**: For client-side routing

## 🛠️ Installation and Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dsa-search-engine.git
   cd dsa-search-engine
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   Or simply push to the main branch and GitHub Actions will deploy automatically.

## 📚 Available Scripts

- `npm run dev` - Start the development server
- `npm run build` - Build for production
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint to check code quality
- `npm run preview` - Preview the production build locally

## 🧠 Data Sources

Currently, the app uses mock data. In a production environment, this would be replaced with:
- A backend API serving algorithm data
- A database containing comprehensive algorithm information
- User-contributed examples and implementations

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Add authentication for user contributions
- Implement algorithm visualizations
- Add complexity comparisons between algorithms
- Create a community section for discussions
- Add a feature to save favorite algorithms
